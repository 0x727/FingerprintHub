# Nmap service detection probe list -*- mode: fundamental; -*-
# $Id$
#
# This is a database of custom probes and expected responses that the
# Nmap Security Scanner ( https://nmap.org ) uses to
# identify what services (eg http, smtp, dns, etc.) are listening on
# open ports.  Contributions to this database are welcome.
# Instructions for obtaining and submitting service detection fingerprints can
# be found in the Nmap Network Scanning book and online at
# https://nmap.org/book/vscan-community.html
