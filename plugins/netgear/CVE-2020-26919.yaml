info:
  name: NETGEAR ProSAFE Plus - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
  author: gy741
  severity: critical
  description: NETGEAR ProSAFE Plus was found to allow any HTML page as a valid endpoint to submit POST requests, allowing debug action via the submitId and debugCmd parameters. The problem is publicly exposed in the login.html webpage, which has to be publicly available to perform login requests but does not implement any restriction for executing debug actions. This will allow attackers to execute system commands.
