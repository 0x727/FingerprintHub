  description: |
    WordPress WPTouch Switch Desktop 3.x  accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.

    An HTTPparameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.

    Open redirect is a failure in that process that makes it possible for attackers to steer users to malicious websites. This vulnerability is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without realizing it. Web users often encounter redirection when they visit the Web site of a company whose name has been changed or which has been acquired by another company. Visiting unreal web page user's computer becomes affected by malware the task of which is to deceive the valid actor and steal his personal data.

    The WPtouch plugin for WordPress is prone to a URI-redirection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. A successful exploit may aid in phishing attacks; other attacks are possible.
