    WordPress RegistrationMagic plugin before 5.0.1.6 contains an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability. The plugin does not escape user input in its rm_chronos_ajax AJAX action before using it in a SQL statement when duplicating tasks in batches. An attacker can possibly obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of the affected site. This is a potential issue in both WordPress and WordPress Administrator.
