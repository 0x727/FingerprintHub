id: CVE-2023-0968

info:
  name: WordPress Watu Quiz <3.3.9.1 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: r3Y3r53
  severity: medium
  description: |
    WordPress Watu Quiz plugin before 3.3.9.1 is susceptible to cross-site scripting. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, such as email, dn, date, and points, before outputting then back in a page. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. This exploit can be used against high-privilege users such as admin.
