id: CVE-2021-39226

info:
  name: Grafana Snapshot authentication bypass
  author: Evan Rubinstein
  description: Grafana instances up to 7.5.11 and 8.1.5 allow remote unauthenticated users to view the snapshot associated with the lowest database key by accesing the literal paths /api/snapshot/:key or /dashboard/snapshot/:key. If the snapshot is in public mode, unauthenticated users can delete snapshots by accesing the endpoint /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Authenticated users can delete snapshots by accesing the endpoints /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, or sending a delete request to /api/snappshot/:key, regardless of wether or not the snapshot is set to public mode (disabled by default). Make sure you obtain permission before testing the delete functionality, as this can cause a denial of service. As always, ensure that you test your results manually to ensure your findings are good. Happy Hunting!
