  name: Prometheus config API endpoint
  author: geeknik
  severity: info
  description: The config endpoint returns the loaded Prometheus configuration file. This file also contains addresses of targets and alerting/discovery services alongside the credentials required to access them. Usually, Prometheus replaces the passwords in the credentials config configuration field with the placeholder <secret> (although this still leaks the username).
