info:
  name: 1Panel SQL Injection - Authenticated
  author: iamnoooob,rootxharsh,pdresearch
  severity: critical
  description: |
    1Panel is a web-based linux server management control panel. There are many sql injections in the project, and some of them are not well filtered, leading to arbitrary file writes, and ultimately leading to RCEs. These sql injections have been resolved in version 1.10.12-tls. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.
