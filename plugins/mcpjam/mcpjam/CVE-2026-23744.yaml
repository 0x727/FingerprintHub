id: CVE-2026-23744

info:
  name: MCPJam Inspector - Remote Code Execution
  author: Louay-075
  severity: critical
  description: |
    MCPJam inspector is the local-first development platform for MCP servers. The Latest version 1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request that triggers the installation of an MCP server, leading to RCE.
  impact: |
    An unauthenticated attacker can remotely execute arbitrary system commands via the exposed /api/mcp/connect endpoint. Successful exploitation leads to full compromise of the affected host.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade MCPJam Inspector to version 1.4.3 or later. Restrict the service to listen on 127.0.0.1.
