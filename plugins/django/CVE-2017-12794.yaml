id: CVE-2017-12794

info:
  name: Django Debug Page - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5 has HTML autoescaping  disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allows a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since run with "DEBUG = True" is not on by default (which is what makes the page visible).
